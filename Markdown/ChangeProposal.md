## Purpose of this document,
I want this document to act as the wall I throw my spaghetti at, see what sticks over time and on second thought. These are all changes I would either like to implement or plan on implementing.
## World Gen
- Reduce structure generation while making them more rewarding or interesting.
    - Ruined Portals
	    - Either Heavily rework or remove entirely.
		- These structures are ugly and spawn too regularly, typically offering the player with too much.
		- Rework
			- Reduce spawns and restrict them to underground only, offering risk or a neat discovery. Also, strictly spawning underground only makes more sense given that the nether represents hell.
			- Increase the chances of the loot table, making them more rewarding.
			- Potentially have some mobs travel through the portal and agro on the player? giving the nether more of a skill barrier and not such a frivolous "whatever" structure.
	- Villages
	- Sunken ships
	- Ocean monuments
- End Rework
	- End Gateways
		- When end gateways spawn, have a beacon spawn above them, offering better visibility.
		- Each beacon has a unique color to identify locations.
