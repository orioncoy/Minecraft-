## Purpose of this document,
I want this document to act as the wall I throw my spaghetti at, see what sticks over time and on second thought. These are all changes I would either like to implement or plan on implementing.

## World Gen
- Reduce structure generation while making them more rewarding or interesting.
    - Ruined Portals
	    - Either Heavily rework or remove entirely.
		- These structures are ugly and spawn too regularly, typically offering the player with too much.
		- Rework
			- Reduce spawns and restrict them to underground only, offering risk or a neat discovery. Also, strictly spawning underground only makes more sense given that the nether represents hell.
			- Increase the chances of the loot table, making them more rewarding.
			- Potentially have some mobs travel through the portal and agro on the player? giving the nether more of a skill barrier and not such a frivolous "whatever" structure.
	- Villages
	- Sunken ships
	- Ocean monuments
- End Rework
	- End Gateways
		- When end gateways spawn, have a beacon spawn above them, offering better visibility.
		- Each beacon has a unique color to identify locations. 

## Mobs
- Phantoms
	- Genuinely baffle how these FUCKERS were added to this game. I hate phantoms so much.
	- Phantoms need heavy rework, their presence does not make sense, and only exist to make the player go to bed? They offer phantom membrane but those are strictly used to repair elytra. But that's assuming the player doesn't have mending by the time they manage to get an elytra. They spawn too often to even exist outside at night and are unmanageable to the extent of ruining the fun of this game.
	- Rework
		- Phantoms should only ever spawn once the player has opened the end portal.
		- Max of one *maybe* two a night, but never any more.
		- Timer resets every time they spawn, so once or twice every three-ish nights.\
		- Phantom membrane is a guaranteed drop with a strong probability of two drops, max of four.
		- Increase phantom membrane repair power to elytra.
- Enderman
	- take away block cringe!

## Gameplay (not organized yet)
- Accessory Slots
	- 
- accessories slot where items can be equipped to passively apply effects
	- remove effects from armor that should be an accessory, water breathing etc.
	- Accessories can be either found, purchased or crafted (maybe)
- Introduce armor sets and armor to cater to other play styles
	- builder sets, miner sets, combat sets etc.
- Enchantments that enhance certain play styles
	- Quickdraw, increases player attack speed etc
- Pinnacle items
	- Items gained through milestones
	- one per character, allows for a large leap in power or ability
	- Example, extra row of health or armor, larger inventory
	- Loadouts
	- Keep inventory
	- Etc
	- One PI equip-able max, even with loadouts
	- Wont drop on death
	- Guaranteed drop on first kill of a boss, random on all subsequent fights
- dedicated slots for emeralds and ammo
	- Helps to clean up and manage inventory
- Artifact book
